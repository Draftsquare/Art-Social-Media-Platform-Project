issues:

1. User signup feature creates 2 entries into the database instead of 1

2. user login form doesn't appear to tell you if something is wrong with the inputted credentials, nor does it seem to know if the login was successful

3. Continuing with 2, if the credentials are right it doesn't redirect you to index. The error makes the user stuck on login indefinitely 

4. Deleting users and posts from database don't make them go away
